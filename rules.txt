The rules of the game 21. Here, all players play against the dealer. Two cards are dealt to each player. The dealer always has their second card hidden, revealing it only after the players' turns. If someone reaches 21 points, it's called Blackjack and guarantees a win, but other players continue playing because they can also reach 21 points during the game. If someone has less than 21, they have two choices: to stop or to ask for another card, but if they exceed 21 points, they lose.

The point count is as follows: all cards with numbers are counted as their face value, while Jack, Queen, and King are counted as 10. An Ace can be counted as either 11 or 1.
